# NutriSnap Usability Evaluation Design

## User Goals

This section outlines the primary user goals that the NutriSnap app aims to address. These goals are derived from user needs and expectations identified in our previous research and development phases.

1. **Goal 1: Easy Food Logging** - Users should be able to quickly and accurately log their food intake using the camera feature.
2. **Goal 2: Accessing Nutritional Information** - Users should easily access and understand the nutritional information of the logged food.
3. **Goal 3: Tracking Nutritional Trends** - Users should be able to review their eating habits over time and gain insights into their nutritional trends.

## Scenarios

Each user goal will be evaluated through specific scenarios. These scenarios are designed to mimic real-world use cases of the NutriSnap app.

1. **Scenario for Goal 1 - Logging a Meal:**
   - **Prompt**: "Log your lunch using the camera feature."
   - **Success**: Successfully capturing the meal image and receiving a confirmation of the log.
2. **Scenario for Goal 2 - Viewing Nutritional Information:**
   - **Prompt**: "Find out the nutritional content of your logged meal."
   - **Success**: User easily navigates to and comprehends the nutritional information displayed.
3. **Scenario for Goal 3 - Reviewing Dashboard:**
   - **Prompt**: "Check your eating daily eating breakdown on the Dashboard."
   - **Success**: User navigates to the Dashboard section and correctly interprets the nutritional data visualization (ring).

## User Types

The NutriSnap app caters to a diverse user base, each with unique needs and preferences.

We prefer users who have had mixed or negative experiences with dieting apps in order to get feedback regarding what they think could be improved.

1. **Experienced Users**: Users with previous experience, either positive or negative, using calorie counting / diet / nutrition apps.
2. **Diet Enthusiasts**: Individuals focused on specific dietary goals or restrictions.

## Recruitment

We plan to recruit participants who represent each of our identified user types.

The recruitment process will include:

- **Marketed Recruitment**: Recruiting individuals via flyers posted on campus, specifically asking for users who have previous experience using food logging / nutrition information apps
- **Monetary Incentive**: $50 gift card to participants who do user testing
- **Online Platforms**: Utilizing social media and online forums to reach a wide audience.
- **Community Outreach**: Engaging with local fitness and health centers.
- **Personal Networks**: Leveraging personal and professional networks to find suitable participants.
