# NutriSnap Usability Evaluation Design

## User Goals

This section outlines the primary user goals that the NutriSnap app aims to address. These goals are derived from user needs and expectations identified in our previous research and development phases.

1. **Goal 1: Easy Food Logging** - Users should be able to quickly and accurately log their food intake using the camera feature.
2. **Goal 2: Accessing Nutritional Information** - Users should easily access and understand the nutritional information of the logged food.
3. **Goal 3: Tracking Nutritional Trends** - Users should be able to review their eating habits over time and gain insights into their nutritional trends.

## Scenarios

Each user goal will be evaluated through specific scenarios. These scenarios are designed to mimic real-world use cases of the NutriSnap app.

1. **Scenario for Goal 1 - Logging a Meal:**
   - **Prompt**: "Log your lunch using the camera feature."
   - **Success**: Successfully capturing the meal image and receiving a confirmation of the log.
2. **Scenario for Goal 2 - Viewing Nutritional Information:**
   - **Prompt**: "Find out the nutritional content of your logged meal."
   - **Success**: User easily navigates to and comprehends the nutritional information displayed.
3. **Scenario for Goal 3 - Reviewing Dashboard:**
   - **Prompt**: "Check your eating daily eating breakdown on the Dashboard."
   - **Success**: User navigates to the Dashboard section and correctly interprets the nutritional data visualization (ring).

## User Types

The NutriSnap app caters to a diverse user base, each with unique needs and preferences.

We prefer users who have had mixed or negative experiences with dieting apps in order to get feedback regarding what they think could be improved.

1. **Experienced Users**: Users with previous experience, either positive or negative, using calorie counting / diet / nutrition apps.
2. **Diet Enthusiasts**: Individuals focused on specific dietary goals or restrictions.

## Recruitment

We plan to recruit participants who represent each of our identified user types.

The recruitment process will include:

- **Marketed Recruitment**: Recruiting individuals via flyers posted on campus, specifically asking for users who have previous experience using food logging / nutrition information apps
- **Monetary Incentive**: $50 gift card to participants who do user testing
- **Online Platforms**: Utilizing social media and online forums to reach a wide audience.
- **Community Outreach**: Engaging with local fitness and health centers.
- **Personal Networks**: Leveraging personal and professional networks to find suitable participants.

## Additional Testing Questions

- Reviewed each screen with participant and asked for feedback and ideas for improvement
- Conducted co-design interviews earlier in the semester asking for ideas and opinions about an AI-based food logging app:

### Open-ended Questions
1. Do you currently or have you ever tracked or logged your food?
2. What methods or tools do you currently use to track your food?
3. What were your primary goals in tracking your food, and what metrics do you prefer to track?
4. What challenges do you face when tracking or logging your food?
5. What are the best features of food logging apps you have previously used, and why?
6. How familiar are you with AI and machine learning?
7. How would you feel about an app that automatically recognizes and logs your food using AI?
8. What concerns would you have about using an AI-powered food logging app? (e.g., accuracy, privacy, data usage)
9. What, if anything, could be done to address those concerns?
10. What features would you find most beneficial in such an app?
11. Are there any specific foods or cuisines you'd want the app to recognize with high accuracy?
12. Would you be interested in having the app log servings or nutritional information based on the recognized food? Why or why not?
13. How important is the app's speed and responsiveness in recognizing and logging food to you?
14. What would make you trust the app's food recognition more?
15. Would you prefer a more hands-on approach where you can correct the app's mistakes, or would you prefer the app to work more autonomously?
16. Are there any features or functionalities you would definitely NOT want in such an app?
17. How do you feel about the app learning from your corrections or inputs, and creating a customized food logging profile for you to increase logging accuracy?
18. What would encourage you to use this app regularly?
19. What social or gamelike features would improve your consistency in food logging?

## Observations and Feedback

During the usability test, detailed observations and participant feedback will be recorded to assess how well the app meets the identified user goals and scenarios.

## Conclusion

This usability evaluation design aims to rigorously test the NutriSnap app's effectiveness in meeting its intended user goals, thereby ensuring a user-centric approach to app development and refinement.
