# Feedback Summary

## Open-Ended Interview Feedback

### Themes and recommendations from open-ended interviews discussing the concept of an AI food logging app:

![Interview Themes by Frequency](images/interview-themes-chart.png)

1. **Ease of Use**:

   - The app should not be time-consuming and logging food should not add significant time overhead to the user's daily routine.
   - Searching databases for exactly the right food can be frustrating, and an app that does this automatically based on a photo be highly desirable.

2. **Accuracy and Recognition of Diverse Foods**:

   - Importance of the AI model recognizing traditional Hawaiian and other ethnic foods.

3. **Privacy**:

   - Two of three users did not care about or have any concerns about privacy.
   - One user had significant concerns about privacy and emphasized the need for clear communication about data usage, storage, and security.
   - Options like end-to-end encryption and storing data on the user's device were viewed positively.

4. **Personalization and Variation in Desired Features**:
   - Variation in desired features, but meal planning, workout tracking, goal tracking, and competitions with friends were popular.
   - Idea of creating an avatar or character to represent the AI.
   - One participant had previously used three different apps simultaneously for food preparation and logging: one to generate recipes based on food in the fridge, one for a photo food journal, and one to track macronutrients and calories. This person wished for a single app to fulfill all three functions.

## User Testing Feedback

### Feedback focused more on the appâ€™s design than interactivity, as the CRUD features are not fully implemented yet.

### Final Critiques and Recommendations

#### 1. Visual Design Update:

- Revise color scheme to be more modern and visually appealing, taking inspiration from apps like 24-hour fitness.
- Implement a warmer color palette, potentially with a darker background and bright accents.

#### 2. Navigation and Layout:

- Maintain the current layout of the bottom bar for its intuitive order.
- Introduce processed/unprocessed/ultraprocessed food categorization in the app onboarding screens.

#### 3. Personal Desires and Preferences Reflection:

- Incorporate missing macronutrient information to meet user expectations.
- Add workout features to enhance the app's appeal and functionality.

#### 4. Enhanced Communication Features:

- **Add a chat box icon in the app bar for quick access to messages with friends and the AI bot.**

### Plans for the Future:

- Conduct two more user testing interviews before the end of the semester.
- Finish CRUD functions by the end of the semester.
- - The app has been submitted as a candidate capstone project for ICS 496 next semester.
