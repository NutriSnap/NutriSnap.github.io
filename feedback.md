## Open-Ended Interview Feedback

### Most interesting themes and recommendations from open-ended interviews discussing the concept of an AI food logging app:
1. **Emotional and Psychological Impact of App Messaging**:
    - Concern about the potential for the app to induce feelings of guilt or anxiety regarding food choices.
    - Emphasis on constructive feedback rather than negative messaging.

2. **Recognition of Diverse Foods**:
    - Importance of the AI model recognizing traditional Hawaiian and other ethnic foods.

3. **Extra Features Desired**:
    - Variation in desired features, but meal planning, workout tracking, goal tracking, and competitions with friends were popular.
    - Idea of creating an avatar or character to represent the AI.

## User Testing Feedback

### Feedback focused more on the appâ€™s design than interactivity, as the CRUD features are not fully implemented yet.

#### Screens

##### 1. Login Screen:

<img src="/images/LoginPage.png" width="300" />

- Warm colors and fruit imagery give a healthy and welcoming impression.
- Design appeals to new users or those wanting to start healthier habits.
- Suggest incorporating a photo or loop video showing high-protein meal preparation to attract experienced users.

##### 2. Dashboard:

<img src="/images/Dashboard.png" width="300" />

- Positive feedback on the food breakdown chart (processed, unprocessed, ultra-processed).
- Appreciation for visible accomplishments and challenges.
- Importance of mindfulness features.
- Desire for detailed macronutrient breakdown.
- Requested push notifications and a checklist on the dashboard for meal logging and other task reminders.

##### 3. Journal:

<img src="/images/Journal.png" width="300" />

- Card layout with half picture, and half information is well-received.
- Suggestion to add meals as headings with snaps for each meal underneath.
- Request for inclusion of macronutrient details in the meal cards (protein, fat, carbohydrates).

##### 4. Trends Page:

<img src="/images/Trends.png" width="300" />

- Interest in viewing weekly or monthly statistics in a chart format.
- Desire to see macronutrient or processed percentage trends over time.

##### 5. Challenges:

<img src="/images/Challenges.png" width="300" />

- Interest in workout and step goal challenges.
- Suggestion for a leaderboard and the ability to form and compete within friend groups.

##### 6. Friends:

<img src="/images/Social.png" width="300" />

- Support for a social feed where users can share meals and progress.
- Endorsement of using the platform for dietitians/personal trainers to offer services.

##### 7. Coach:

<img src="/images/Coach.png" width="300" />

- Willingness to pay for AI-based and human coaching services, with a preference for video interaction with human coaches.

##### 8. Settings:

<img src="/images/Settings.png" width="300" />

- Desire for the ability to silence social features.
- Suggestion to add a specific goals page for detailed goal-setting.

##### 9. Extra Features Desired:
- Request for an exercise tracking and workout planning feature.

##### 10. Food Logging Activity:
    - Positive feedback on the quick and easy logging process.
    - Preference for a warmer, less stark color scheme in the app's design.

##### 11. Journal Page Activity:
    - Recommendation to include percentage numbers and macronutrient breakdown on meal cards.

##### 12. Dashboard Ring Analysis Activity:
    - Affirmation of the clarity and usefulness of the nutrition breakdown ring.

### Final Critiques and Recommendations

#### 1. Visual Design Update:
- Revise color scheme to be more modern and visually appealing, taking inspiration from apps like 24-hour fitness.
- Implement a warmer color palette, potentially with a darker background and bright accents.

#### 2. Navigation and Layout:
- Maintain the current layout of the bottom bar for its intuitive order.
- Introduce processed/unprocessed/ultraprocessed food categorization in the app onboarding screens.

#### 3. Personal Desires and Preferences Reflection:
- Incorporate missing macronutrient information to meet user expectations.
- Add workout features to enhance the app's appeal and functionality.

#### 4. Enhanced Communication Features:
- Add a chat box icon in the app bar for quick access to messages with friends and the AI bot.

### Plans for the Future:
- Conduct two more user testing interviews before the end of the semester.
- Focus on getting the CRUD and camera functions working at a minimum before any further user testing after this semester.
- The app has been submitted as a capstone project for ICS 496 for the next semester.
