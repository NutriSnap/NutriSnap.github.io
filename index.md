## Motivation

#### Problem:

* Chronic diseases associated with overweight and obesity reduce quality of life and cause early deaths for millions of people worldwide 
* Dietary assessment methods traditionally used in healthcare settings are subject to inaccuracies - most people underestimate their caloric consumption by 10 - 40% 
* Current calorie counting apps require manually typing in each food item consumed; weighing is required for accurate portion estimation; barcode scanner is convenient but encourages consumption of prepackaged foods which are often highly processed

#### Solution:

* Use machine learning to automatically recognize foods and calculate portion sizes when they are brought into the camera view; model gets more accurate over time as it learns your commonly consumed foods
* Categorize foods into unprocessed, processed, and ultra-processed categories; show breakdown and trends in diet quality visually

## Goals

Harness the power of cutting-edge ML to automatically identify and log your food, bringing clarity to your eating habits. Lets make every bite count - not by its calories but by its value. Discover a sustainable approach to health powered by cutting-edge tech and genuine human expertise.
