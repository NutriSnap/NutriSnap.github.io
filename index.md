## Data Model

The data model encompasses a holistic representation of a user's nutritional and meal tracking application. Central to the model is the `UserData`, which maintains user details and settings, linking to their meals, snaps (visual representations of their meals), and their progress in challenges. Each snap captures specifics like its contents and images. `Meal` records are detailed with processed food percentages, and they can be associated with multiple snaps. Users can earn `Badges`, have specific app `Settings`, and track `Trends` in their eating habits. `Challenges` provide users with goals, and their progress is tracked in `ChallengeProgress`. Additionally, foods in snaps have individual item details maintained in `SnapFoodItem`. The model offers an interconnected system for users to visualize, track, and improve their eating habits.
